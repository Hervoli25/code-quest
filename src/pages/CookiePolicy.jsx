          <p>
            This Cookie Policy explains how Code Quest ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies 
            to recognize you when you visit our website and use our services. It explains what these technologies are 
            and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. 
            Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well 
            as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Code Quest) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set 
            by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable 
            third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive 
            content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when 
            it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons 
            in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other 
            cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. 
            Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our website and the purposes they perform are
